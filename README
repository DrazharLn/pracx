/*
 * PlotinusRedux's GUI improvements and renderer for SMACX
 *
 * This library is intended to be imported by the SMAC binary and to then cause
 * SMAC to call functions in this library, sometimes instead of certain of its
 * traditional components, sometimes purely in addition.
 *
 * PRACX inserts extra code into SMAC's native map rendering and drawing code, as
 * well as some aspects of base management screens. PRACX also registers to
 * receive user interaction events from the OS's window manager and can control
 * scrolling and zooming behaviour, amongst other things.
 *
 * The combined effect is that PRACX replaces the main UI of the game, allowing
 * new features and overlays to be implemented in C++, rather than hacked into
 * terran(x).exe in assembly.
 *
 * PRACX implements these improvements to the UI:
 * 	Configurable full screen resolution
 * 	Working windowed mode
 * 	Custom menu for PRACX options
 * 	Mouse over support for view mode (V)
 * 	Scrolling
 * 		Pixel level scrolling
 * 		Right click and drag scrolling
 * 		Configurable edge scroll zone size and speed
 * 	Zooming
 * 		Pixel-level re-centering: no more screen zigzag
 * 		Automatically sets reasonable min, max, and increment values for the current resolution
 * 		Mouse wheel zooms in and out
 * 		Configurable # of increments between min and max zoom
 * 		Details (units, cities, improvements, etc.) are now shown even when fully zoomed out
 * 	Overlays
 * 		Resource overlay with ALT+R: normal/current yield of tile/potential yield
 * 		Terrain overlay with ALT+T: normal/faction ownership/elevation/rainfall/rockiness
 * 		City mode: unworked tiles show potential yield in grey
 *
 * Function names beginning with "PRACX" belong to the PRACX functions, these
 * are called from the SMAC binary (terran(x).exe). SMAC is hacked to call
 * these functions by the HOOK function at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * Functions called from m_pAC are functions in the SMAC binary (SMAC
 * functions).
 *
 * Other functions are typically unexported helper functions for the PRACX
 * functions.
 *
 * "Thunk"s are bits of assembly code that are used mostly to insert function
 * calls into the SMAC code where previously the code did not call any
 * functions.
 *
 * The m_ST structure contains the value of configuration options as read from
 * Alpha Centauri.ini
 *
 * Most comments (including this header) were written by Draz. If they have
 * question marks, they're guesses. If they don't, they're confident guesses :)
 *
 * I've commented on the purpose of most functions and other chunks of code,
 * and in a bit more detail about some aspects, but the commentary is still
 * lacking, especially for some of the more complicated functions.
 *
 * Of course, this code is tightly coupled with the SMACX code, so a complete
 * understanding of what's going on isn't possible without looking at the
 * dissassembled code for that, but maintenance of this code and some
 * extensions might now be possible.
